<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Julie. I'm starting this journey in hope that I will eventually land a job that's related  to Wev Dev and the other reason is my brother wants me to make him a website.  
I'm very enthusiastic about this whole web development thing. I'm just starting to learn about it so I may not be very good at this.
</p>

<p>I am enjoying coding so far and happy that I'm being productive. Other stuff that I enjoy doing is reading manga, watching anime, reading psychology books, playing online games, and listening to music.</p>
