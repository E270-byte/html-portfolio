<h1>Best Movies for Me </h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time.</h2><hr>
<h3>The Hand Maiden</h3>
<p> The Hand Maiden is a story about two woman falling inlove. This is by far the best GL movie that i have watched. The plot make sence and the actors are just great. </p>
<h3>Miracle in Cell No.7</h3>
<p>This movie cracks me up everytime. Acting was great, you feel the pain that the main character feels.

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>This one is a classic. I don't know why it's very catchy. If i can watch a movie again for the first, this one is what i'll pick.</p>
